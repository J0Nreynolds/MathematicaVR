# MathematicaVR
HackPrinceton Spring 2016 hack

Creating a means to access the 3D representations and models made in Wolfram Mathematica in real-time VR.

Currently going through further development. May be refactored to be a means of just generally interfacing Mathematica with Unity, excluding the specificity of VR.
